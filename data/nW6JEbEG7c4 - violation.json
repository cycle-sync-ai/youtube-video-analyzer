    "transcript": "V březnu 2024 jsem vypustil pdf zdarma s výběrem 3+1 akcí, které v tom březnu jsem nakup zrovna do portfolia.",
    "violatedReason": "The statement in the YouTube transcript can be perceived as a personalized recommendation because the speaker shared specific actions they personally took (\"které v tom březnu jsem nakup zrovna do portfolia\"). This can be construed as an individualized recommendation if listeners perceive this advice as being tailored to them or consider it as a personal endorsement. According to the legal rules extracted, individual recommendations are subject to stricter regulatory scrutiny, and what was provided might blur the lines between general information and a personalized recommendation. Therefore, the content potentially violates the principles regarding personalized investment advice under Article 9 and recital 14 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565, which requires careful consideration of personalization and the context in which the recommendation is made.",
