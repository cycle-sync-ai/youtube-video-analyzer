    "violatedReason": "The statement in the YouTube transcript, \"Všechny tyhle akce držím ve svých portfoliích,\" suggests that the speaker personally holds the stocks mentioned. While this may seem like a mere personal disclosure, the context is crucial. Given the rules on investment advice, such a statement might be perceived by viewers as an implicit endorsement or recommendation of these stocks, especially if viewers identify with the speaker or trust their expertise.\n\nThis could be categorized under \"Nepřímá prezentace,\" akin to suggesting that people similar to the viewers or the speaker might benefit from these stocks. According to the rules, information given through online platforms can be interpreted as investment advice if a viewer perceives it as a suitable recommendation for them (Role distribučních kanálů a vnímání zákazníkem). While the presentation is public, there's a risk that it could be misconstrued as a recommendation targeted at individuals with similar portfolios, personal situations, or values as the speaker. Hence, it may contravene the rule that requires clarity that public recommendations are not personalized or intended as direct financial advice.",

    "violatedReason": "The statement in the YouTube transcript discusses investment opportunities such as investing in water, companies that have the potential to benefit the planet, and cryptocurrency mining machines using artificial intelligence, which promise a certain annual return. According to the extracted legal rules, this could be problematic for several reasons:\n\n1. **Public vs. Personal Recommendation (Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565)**: If the presenter is not providing this information personally tailored but is generalizing it to the public (everyone encounters such offers), it risks being viewed as a public recommendation rather than personal. However, even public recommendations can be problematic if they are implicitly or explicitly made to seem personal or suitable for each listener.\n\n2. **Role of Distribution Channels**: Using a platform like YouTube, while public, can carry the risk of listeners perceiving the advice as applicable or recommended specifically for them, thereby possibly fulfilling the criteria of investment advice if they are made to view it as suitable information directly applicable to their situation.\n\n3. **Consumer Protection Concerns**: There is an emphasis in the legal rules on ensuring consumers are not misled into believing that generalized recommendations are suitable for their individual circumstances. In the transcript, the suggestion of a guaranteed annual return could mislead consumers into perceiving it as a targeted, reliable investment opportunity.\n\n4. **Responsibility of the Provider**: The rules highlight the responsibility of those giving investment advice or discussing investment products to ensure they do not mislead consumers about the nature of the recommendations. The promise of certain returns mentioned in the video might suggest an outcome that cannot be guaranteed, which can mislead consumers.\n\nIn summary, while the investment discussion in the transcript appears to be a general statement, the manner in which it is presented on a broad platform and its promise of guaranteed returns without presentation of associated risks may conflict with guidelines meant to ensure consumer understanding and protection against misleading investment advice.",

    "violatedReason": "The YouTube transcript mentions that a client called Ondro, expressing concern about having 25 million Czech Koruna in a savings account yielding 34%, and being nervous about it. This scenario appears to involve giving financial advice directly to a specific individual, which could constitute \"osobní doporučení\" (personal recommendation) under the Definice osobního doporučení rule. According to *Čl. 9 nařízení (EU) 2017/565*, investment advice is considered personal when provided to an individual based on their personal circumstances. Since a client called seeking advice about their personal financial situation, any advice given in response could be seen as personalized investment advice, which could contravene the defined rules by not being appropriately assessed for the client’s circumstances according to Czech law.",

    "violatedReason": "The statement \"Klidně to pošlete do investic, klidně to pošlete do akcií\" can be considered as providing investment advice. According to the extracted legal rules from the government article, this could fall under personal recommendation if it is directed to an individual considering their personal circumstances (Čl. 9 nařízení (EU) 2017/565). The fact that the speaker mentions they called their bank suggests this advice was provided in a personalized manner, targeting specific financial needs (\"za 6 měsíců tyhle peníze nutně potřebuji na další projekt\"). There is no indication that this was public advice; therefore, it may not qualify for the exclusion applicable to general public recommendations. As a result, this could inadvertently contravene the rules about personal investment advice under MiFID II guidelines. Additionally, the recommendation lacks evidence of compliance with required assessments whether the investment meets the needs of the target market, as outlined in the rules regarding adherence to product governance (§ 12ba and § 12bb zákona č. 256/2004 Sb.).",

    "violatedReason": "The transcript seems to describe a situation where a bank employee provides investment advice to an individual, recommending investment in stocks or funds over a period of months. According to the rules extracted from the government article, investment advice is considered personal advice if it is given to a specific person or group with regard to their personal circumstances (Čl. 9 nařízení (EU) 2017/565). The description suggests that the advice was specifically directed at an individual and therefore could be considered personal advice, which necessitates compliance with regulations for investment advice, such as verifying whether the investment product suits the individual's needs. This raises concerns as such advice should not mislead customers to believe they are receiving individualized recommendations when they are, in fact, generic. The rules emphasize the necessity to avoid misleading presentations as personal advice (Role distribučních kanálů a vnímání zákazníkem and Znak personalizace výběru příjemců).",

    "violatedReason": "The statement in the YouTube transcript indicates that the individual is providing information that helps members of his investment community on Patreon understand investments and make money. This could potentially be considered as providing investment advice or recommendations. According to the Extracted Legal Rules, specifically under the section \"Klíčová pravidla a principy vyplývající z článku,\" advice or recommendations could be considered as personal recommendations if they are directed at a specific person or group of persons regarding their personal circumstances. \n\nFurthermore, the role of distribution channels, like the internet and electronic correspondence (in this case, the Patreon platform), could fulfill the characteristics of investment advice if the customer perceives it to be a suitable recommendation for them (section on \"Role distribučních kanálů a vnímání zákazníkem\"). The statement does not clarify whether the advice is personalized or if members are directed to public recommendations but could imply personalized advice by mentioning the community and the benefits they gain. This lack of clarity risks contravening consumer protection laws, as they protect against recommendations posing as individualized but intended for a broad audience without genuine justification for target group selection, as noted in the \"Ochrana spotřebitele\" section.",

    "violatedReason": "The statement from the YouTube transcript could contravene the legal rules related to investment advice. The phrase \"Komunitě už nás je okolo 6000 investorů, kteří nechávají své peníze pracovat pro ně, I když třeba spí\" implies a general recommendation to join a community of investors. Although this recommendation appears to be aimed at the public, it carries undertones of a personal recommendation by suggesting trust and success (\"nechávají své peníze pracovat pro ně, I když třeba spí\"). This could be perceived by individuals as a suitable recommendation for them specifically based on the success of a similar group, thereby touching on the criteria for personal investment advice as defined in the extracted legal rules. Specifically, the manner of presentation aligns with the notion of indirect recommendation and potentially creates a perception among recipients that it is suitable for their personal financial strategy. This could be a breach of the investment advice regulations, specifically those that caution against recommendations masquerading as individualized when they target a broad audience without a personalized basis.",
